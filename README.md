# tz-intertrans-py
tz-intertrans but in Python, because Python is much, much faster to create something simple


## Features/TODO
- [ ] input localtime/UTC/TZ -> output list of TZ times
- [ ] toml configuration file
- [ ] cli interface for interaction?


## Contributing
tz-intertrans is the main project, and this is the super fast mockup *for now*.
