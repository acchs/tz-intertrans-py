# tz-intertrans-py
**Honestly I'm kinda giving up on this project. Unix-like systems' `date` implementation is superior, and takes much less time. This is more of an exercise to try out some stuff in Python. If you're using Windows, sorry, but spinning up a Linux VM or using WSL is probably faster.**
tz-intertrans but in Python, because Python is much, much faster to create something simple


## Using the project

1. clone repo, cd into repo
2. activate environment for dependencies with `source venv/bin/activate`
3. `cd src`
4. `python3 main.py`

## Features/TODO
- [x] input localtime/UTC/TZ -> output list of TZ times
- [ ] toml configuration file
- [ ] cli interface for interaction?


## Contributing
tz-intertrans is the main project, and this is the super fast mockup *for now*.
